This repositiory contains the solutions to the various programming challenges I complete from HackThisSite. I intend to code them all in Python. I will add the solutions as I find time to complete them.

These repository is for personal use and reference for others. Nobody is stopping you from copying my work. You are only cheating yourself if you copy without understanding the code.
